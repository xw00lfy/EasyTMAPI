# EasyTMAPI
PS3 TMAPI Library to make RTM or what ever development with TMAPI easier.

This is an open source project started by CoolMAN to make PS3 Real-Time-Modding development easier when using the Target Manager API.
Most RTM Tools focused on CCAPI, as the most popular library PS3Lib features very easy to learn and use syntax for CCAPI and features
nearly all or all functions that CCAPI has while on TMAPI, it doesn't have much, only stuff like InitTargetComms, SetMemory, GetMemory,
PowerOn and PowerOff etc. not much, if you look at ps3tmapi_net. It features many functions, many.

-Disconnect
-ForceDisconnect
-Attach
-KillProcess
-ContinueProcess
-PowerOn
-PowerOff
